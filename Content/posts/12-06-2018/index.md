 ## Finally!
 One thing that gets me out of the winter blues is browsing all the cute spring pieces. I was looking for some pretty flirty dresses and came across so many cute feminine finds that I wanted to share with you guys. Everything is under $100 too! I found this flirty dress that comes in 9 colors – it’s such a pretty silhouette and perfect for any upcoming events and an amazing price point. I also can’t believe this one is under $100. Another one of my favorite finds was this pair of sandals. I’m obsessed with the animal print but it also comes in 3 other colors. So good! Below are a few more great finds all under $100.<br></br>

 ## What's new?
 
Searching for online style inspiration, it’s easy to fall down the black hole of Insta-hell. When you finally look up from your phone, you realise you’ve spent two whole days scrolling through feeds – and you’re still in your dressing gown, with no idea what to wear (we’ve all been there). Which sort of defeats the point.<br></br>

Well never fear, we’ve done the hard search for you. From our favourite UK influencers to the best missives from Milan and the coolest New Yorkers, read on for our definitive guide to the best fashion blogs (and more importantly, where to shop their looks).We started with our store in Le Marais, so definitely will continue to look into our retail stores development around the world in 2020. We are currently looking at cities like Tokyo and Beijing, as we already have our first international store in Shanghai. In the UK we are very well represented at Harvey Nichols, Selfridges and Browns. In terms of product, shoes came very naturally for me, as I work with leather on a daily basis. Our next big development will be my first RTW collection, it’s a new challenge that we are very excited about, will keep you posted on its show date!
